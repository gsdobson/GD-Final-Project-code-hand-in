				Here is a collection of images and text notation of the once in a life time adventure. You’ll view the story of the trip and the details of the challenges encountered.

				The following text has been stolen and will need to be replaced when complete.
				The track has been described as one of the great wilderness walks in the world, with its remoteness being a particular attraction.

				Whilst quite a deal of work has been done on the track, great pains have been taken to keep it simple with pit toilets at each major campsite the only construction (aside from track work) visible.
				Melaleuca to Cockle Creek…Or Cockle Creek to Melaleuca

				The majority of walkers walk from Melaleuca to Cockle Creek for 1 very logical reason.

				Weather conditions play a major part in how quickly the track can be walked.  There are numerous scenarios that could delay the walk and it’s for this reason most people (something like 95%) prefer to fly in to Melaleuca and walk out.

				If you walk from Cockle Creek to Melaleuca you could well be held up and miss your flight out.
